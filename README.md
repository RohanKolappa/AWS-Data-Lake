Taking SQS messages from populated queue and writing each row/message to S3 in parquet format. To improve the current process, I am looking to extend the functionality by adding event-based triggers and batch processing. I want to process the rows, store the output in memory, use visibility timeouts, and then once we process all the files in the queue the output should be stored in parquet format.
