Optimized the core logic to reduce the number of API calls and S3 requests, leading to lower operational costs. Implemented batch processing, storing 1000 rows at a time before converting them into a Pandas DataFrame and writing the data in Parquet format to S3. Integrated visibility timeouts to avoid immediate deletion of SQS messages, allowing other consumers to process the same messages after a set period. This change ensures efficient message processing while maintaining message availability for other consumers.
